      Bird abundances have been determined from timed censuses, territory maps and nest 
locations at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest from 1969 to the present. 
This data set includes counts of the number of adult birds (males and females) 
per 10 ha at HBEF (1969 - present) and on three additional plots within the 
White Mountain National Forest (1986 - 2000).
      These data were gathered as part of the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study (HBES). 
The HBES is a collaborative effort at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, which is 
operated and maintained by the USDA Forest Service, Northern Research Station.

          LOCATION DESCRIPTION
          HBEF data obtained in 10-ha bird study plot, adjacent to (south/southwest) 
of Weir 6. Other 3 "replicate" sites located outside HBEF, but in nearby sections 
of the White Mountain National Forest at same elevations and aspects and in stands 
with simlar forest history and vegetation. These are as follows:
          1) Moosilauke, 8 km north of HBEF. Plot located 100 m NW of NH route 118, 
8 km west of North Woodstock NH (in township of Woodstock, NH).
          2) Russell Pond, 11 km NE of HBEF. Plot located 1.2 km SW of Russell Pond, Thornton, NH.
          3) Stinson Mountain, 13 km SW of HBEF. Plot located 1.7 km E of Stinson Mountain lookout tower, Rumney, NH.
          SAMPLING DESIGN
          Bird abundances have been determined from timed censuses, territory maps, nest locations, Counts 
are the number of adult birds (males and females) per 10 ha, taking into account territories 
that partially overlap the 10 hectare area. A full description of the sampling methods can be found in Holmes et al, 1986.
